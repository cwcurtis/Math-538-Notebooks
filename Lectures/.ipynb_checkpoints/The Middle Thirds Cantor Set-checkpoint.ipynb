    "\n",
    "So, throughout this course, we will routinely return to a construct which underpins a lot of the stranger results in mathematics.  This construct is known as the _ Middle Thirds Cantor Set _.  The construction of this set is reasonable straightforward to explain.  Start with the interval \n",

    "C_{0} = \\left[0,1\\right].  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, I know _ interval _ usually means we use a variable like $I$, but just hang in there, you'll see where I'm going with this.  Now, with $C_{0}$ defined, we define the next interval $C_{1}$ to be \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{1} = \\left[0,\\frac{1}{3}\\right]\\cup\\left[\\frac{2}{3},1\\right].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $C_{1}$ is just $C_{0}$ with the middle third removed.  We note that $C_{1}\\subset C_{0}$, and thus $C_{1}=C_{1}\\cap C_{0}$.  So now, all we do is keep repeating the process.  \n",
