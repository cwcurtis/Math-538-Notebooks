Since there is only one critical point in $[0,1]$, then we can only have one well defined basin for an attractive fixed point or cycle, and thus there can only ever be one at a time.  Otherwise then, every fixed point or cycle must be repellant.  "

    "So bringing this all together then, suppose we have a family of maps $f_{\\lambda}$.  If we have that for some $n$ that ${\\bf p}_{n}\\leq K(f_{\\lambda})$, which is not such a crazy thing to assume since if we have that $f_{\\lambda}$ has a periodic cycle at all, it must also have ${\\bf p}_{n}$ as a periodic orbit.  If we can further establish that ${\\bf p}_{n}=K(f_{\\lambda})$, then as we push this $2^{n}$-cycle to the point of instability by increasing $\\lambda$ to $\\lambda_{\\ast}$, then we must necessarily have a period-doubling bifurcation where the new periodic orbit post bifurcation must also have the itinerary ${\\bf p}_{n}$.
