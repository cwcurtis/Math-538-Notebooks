    "So while this course is not necessarily focused on rigor, it is unavoidable that at various points in the course we will need to make recourse to several core concepts from analysis.  That being said, most of what we will need can be framed entirely within one dimension,and so unless very clearly, and very explicitly stated otherwise, we can do almost everything we will need with respect to one variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, let me explain the entire course in about one line.  Suppose we have a function $f(x)$, where $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.  Pick an initial point $x_{0}$.  Define a sequence $\\left\\{x_{n}\\right\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ via the equation\n",

Note, by $f:[a,b]\\rightarrow [a,b]$, we mean only that the image of $f$ over $[a,b]$, is contained within $[a,b]$.  It need not always equal $[a,b]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, we would like some means of then characterizing in advance when a subset of the real line may or may not be compact.  To do this, we first need to remind ourselves of the formal definitions of open and closed sets on the real line.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">**$\\epsilon$-interval**: For $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we define the $\\epsilon$-interval around $x$ to be $I_{\\epsilon}(x)=\\left\\{y\\in\\mathbb{R}:|x-y|<\\epsilon\\right\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Open Set**: A set $E\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is open if for every $x\\in E$, there is some $\\epsilon>0$ such that $I_{\\epsilon}(x)\\in E$. Note, in effect, we have that any open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ is a union of different $I_{\\epsilon}(x)$ subsets.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Closed Set**: A set $E\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is closed if its complement, $E^{c}=\\mathbb{R}\\backslash E=\\left\\{y\\in\\mathbb{R}:y\\notin E\\right\\}$ is open.  \n",

    "\n",
    ">**Closure of a Subset**: Let $E'$ be the set of accumulation points of $E$.  We call $\\bar{E}=E\\cup E'$ the closure of $E$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Boundary of a Set**: We define the boundary of a subset $E\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ to be $\\partial E = \\bar{E}\\cap \\bar{E^{c}}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Connected Subsets**: Let $E\\subset \\mathbb{R}$.  Define an open subset _ relative _ to $E$ to be any set $E\\cap O$, where $O$ is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$ (i.e. a collection of open intervals).  We say that $E$ is connected if it cannot be written as the disjoint union of two relatively open subsets, i.e. we cannot write $E=H\\cup K$, where $H$ and $K$ are relatively open in $E$ and $H \\cap K = \\emptyset$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Continuous Functions**: A function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at a point $x$ if for all $\\epsilon>0$ there exists a $\\delta>0$ such that if $|x-y|<\\delta$, then $|f(x)-f(y)|<\\epsilon$. \n",

    "Let's briefly remind ourselves of some key facts associated with these statements.  The first is \n",

    "> Some sets are neither open nor closed.  See (a,b], [a,b) for example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Arbitrary unions of open sets are open, i.e. if $O_{j}$, $j=0,1,\\cdots$ are open, then so is $\\cup_{j}O_{j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed, i.e. if $C_{j}$, $j=0,1,\\cdots$ are closed, then so is $\\cap_{j} C_{j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Finite intersections of open sets are open.  Finite unions of closed sets are closed.  But when we take an infinite limit in either case, we cannot say whether the limiting set is open or closed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> If $E$ is closed then $E=\\bar{E}$, and the set of accumulation points of $E$ is identical to the boundary of $E$.  If $E$ is open, then again its set of accumulation points is identical to its boundary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is frustrating that the definition of a connected set is so long-winded.  But it does make sense.  For example, you should be able to see why $E=[1,3/2)\\cup(3/2,2]$ is disconnected.  If I use as my open sets in $\\mathbb{R}$ $(1-\\epsilon,3/2)$ and $(3/2,2+\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon>0$, then we see that relative to $E$,the two disjoint sets which we used to define $E$ are open, and therefore we can write $E$ as the union of disjoint open sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">Likewise, if we let $E=[1,2]$, then if we supposed that $E$ were disconnected, that would mean there were two disjoint relatively open sets $H$ and $K$ such that $[1,2]=H\\cup K$, which is to say every point in $[1,2]$ was either in $H$ or $K$.  The sets being relatively open though means that there are sequences within both $H$ and $K$ which must converge to points not in the set, but $[1,2]$ is closed, and therefore we have a contradiction.     \n",
    "\n",
    ">So, we have a couple of equivalent statements of continuity.  The most important one is that if $f$ is continuous, then if $x_{n}\\rightarrow x$, then $f(x_{n})\\rightarrow f(x)$.  The other is a bit weirder, and says that if $f(x)\\in E$, and $E$ is open, then there is an open subset $U$ such that $x\\in U$ and $f(U)\\subset E$.  We will use the first statement constantly.  The second one, not as often, but see the problems below.    \n",

    "_ Problem _: Show that the set of accumulation points $E'$ of a subset $E$ is closed.  \n",

    "_ Problem _: Show that $\\bar{E}$ is closed.\n",

    "Thus we already see a rather interesting result with regards to unimodal maps.  In effect, unimodal maps ensure that any iterative sequence necessarily has a convergent subsequence in trapping interval $[0,1]$.  What is worth keeping in mind is that we do not know without far more work what the convergence subsequence is, or if there is only one.  As we will show, unimodal maps are able to generate _ very _ complicated sequences which do not have ready characterizations.  \n",
