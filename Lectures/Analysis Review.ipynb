    "So while this course is not necessarily focused on rigor, it is unavoidable that at various points in the course we will need to make recourse to several core concepts from analysis.  That being said, most of what we will need can be framed entirely within one dimension,and so unless very clearly, and very explicitly stated otherwise, we can do almost everything we will need with respect to one variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, let me explain the entire course in about one line.  Suppose we have a function $f(x)$, where $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.  Pick an initial point $x_{0}$.  Define a sequence $\\left\\{x_{n}\\right\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ via the equation\n",

    "Note, we do not even need to make many requirements on $f$ in this class.  To wit, we define the circle map $C_{\\alpha,n}(x)$ via the equation\n",

    "What we mean by this is that $C_{\\alpha,n}$ maps the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ to the interval $[-n,n]$, where at every point $x_{j} = jn/\\alpha$, the function \"resets\" to zero.  Thus, for example the circle map $C_{2,1}(x)$ looks like \n",

    "\n",

    "Of particular interest in this course are the family of _ unimodal _ maps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Unimodal Map**: A function $f$ is said to be unimodal if there exists a closed bounded interval $[a,b]$ such that $f:[a,b]\\rightarrow[a,b]$, $f(a)=f(b)$, and there exists a unique point $c\\in(a,b)$ called the _ turning point _ such that $f$ is _ strictly increasing _ on $[a,c)$ and is _ strictly decreasing _ on $(c,b]$. Note, by $f:[a,b]\\rightarrow [a,b]$, we mean only that the image of $f$ over $[a,b]$, is contained within $[a,b]$.  It need not always equal $[a,b]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the _ strictly increasing _ and _ strictly decreasing _ is not strictly necessary (hehe, couldn't help it), but we will never look at an example in this course where this is not the case, so I am making life a little easier here.  \n",

    "Examples of this that we will talk about at length in this course are _ Tent Maps _, $T_{\\mu}(x)$ where \n",

    "Thus we see that $T_{\\mu}(x)$ will be unimodal for $0\\leq\\mu\\leq2$, where $T_{\\mu}:[0,1]\\rightarrow[0,1]$ with turning point $c=1/2$.  \n",

    "So what is it about unimodal maps that makes them so interesting?  Well, remember the central question of the course.  Suppose we have a unimodal map $f:[0,1]\\rightarrow[0,1]$, and we choose $x_{0}\\in [0,1]$. Then we necessarily see that the entire sequence generated from this choice must always stay in $[0,1]$, i.e. \n",

    "Thus, the sequence $\\left\\{x_{n}\\right\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ is trapped in the closed, bounded interval $[0,1]$.  This motivates us to remind ourselves of the definition of a compact set.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, we would like some means of then characterizing in advance when a subset of the real line may or may not be compact.  To do this, we first need to remind ourselves of the formal definitions of open and closed sets on the real line.  \n",

    ">**$\\epsilon$-interval**: For $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, we define the $\\epsilon$-interval around $x$ to be $I_{\\epsilon}(x)=\\left\\{y\\in\\mathbb{R}:|x-y|<\\epsilon\\right\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Open Set**: A set $E\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is open if for every $x\\in E$, there is some $\\epsilon>0$ such that $I_{\\epsilon}(x)\\in E$. \n",
